        "Untitled", 19 x 24 inches, Gesso and charcoal

<p>
    This is a painting/drawing I made of Björk. Björk is my favorite musical artist. There's nothing I can say 
    about her that hasn't been said. She makes fantastic art and is a huge inspiration to me. This piece was done with gesso and charcoal.
