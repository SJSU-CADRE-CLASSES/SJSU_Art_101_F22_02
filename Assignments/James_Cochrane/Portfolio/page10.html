<h3>
   "Zoom", Video
</h3>
</center>

<p>
    I made "Zoom" as a response to the experience I was having that semester in school. I had moved out of my parent's house
    for the first time, was eating pathetically, and was learning Adobe After Effects through Zoom. Life was interesting.
    My sanity was tested like never before. My stress tolerance broke into a new echelon. My day-to-day consisted of sleeping, eating,
    and near-constant invasive stress over responsibilities. Food and sleep were my respite and still are, to some degree. But things are better now.
