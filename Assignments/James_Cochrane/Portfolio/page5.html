        "World Domination", 648p x 864p, Blender

    <p>
        This piece is the first original work I made in Blender. My idea for this piece came from feelings I
        had when learning Blender basics. Learning the software, or becoming one with the machine, made me think about humanity and
        its relationship with technology. I thought about how humanity and technology will continue to meld, either
        for the benefit of the planet or at its expense. Our technological prowess adds more and more to our strength as a species, but to what end?
