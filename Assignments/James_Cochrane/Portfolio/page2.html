  <p>      
I made this piece intending to take a work of art from long ago and recreate it in a digital format.
I chose Rembrandt's piece of the same name because I find its subject matter to be interesting. Man vs. the angel,
who is essentially god in humanoid form. Though I am not religious, there is something relatable about the idea of wrestling with god for hours on end.
Perhaps it is the struggle against a great intangible force that manifests as a battle between you and someone who is much like you. I made the image
by blocking out colors into matching shapes and piecing them all together.
