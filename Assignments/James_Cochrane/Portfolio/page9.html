<h3>
    "Sabotage", Video
</h3>
</center>

<p>
    "Sabotage" is a video I made from the Beastie Boys' music video for you guessed it, their song, Sabotage.  
    I removed the audio that would've been the song and did my best to recreate what I thought the video would sound like if there were no music,
    just on-site sound. I sabotaged Sabotage. I used foley sounds that I made as well as a few from the internet. A bit cheeky.
