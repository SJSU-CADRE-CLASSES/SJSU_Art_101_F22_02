    This piece was an exploratory exercise in isometric optical illusions. When I made it, I wasn't considering the context or meaning of the colors.
    Looking at it now, I think of politics, confusion, conflict, and indifference. Likely due to the time I made it, amid Donald Trump's presidency.
    Perhaps I chose the colors subconsciously at the time.
