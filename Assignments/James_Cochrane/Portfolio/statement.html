        Artist Statement

Hello. My name is James Cochrane. I am 23 years old and come from Redding, California. I’m a transfer student who endured three trying years at Shasta College 
and is proud to have come this far. I am a new initiate in the world of art. Art is something that I thought I had a strong connection with while growing up. 
Starting around middle school, my peers knew me as the kid capable of drawing flames and whatever else requested from me to some degree. 
I probably would’ve told you I was good at art. I’m not trying to come down too hard on 10-year-old me, but, in reality, I had no concept of what art was. 
In my head, art meant you made a nice-looking picture that closely resembled some source material, unless it was abstract, in which case it was just odd-looking shapes and colors. 
I had a similarly rudimentary view of music as well. I quit drawing until I got to community college, where I decided I wanted to pursue creativity academically. 
At first, I wanted to be a marine biologist, but then I remembered that I barely passed CP Chemistry in high school. From then up until now, I’ve been taking art classes. 
Somewhere along the way, a figurative big bang of art appreciation took place. 
I realized that for my entire life, and still to some degree, I have been unaware of the deeper meanings and essences of art and facets of the world in general. 
In the past few years, art has become indescribably valuable to me. Through it, I have come to see the world through what feels like a new set of eyes. 
Art has shown me just how beautiful and flawed the people and world around us are, as well as a glimpse of what is possible through human expression. 
Where I was once uninterested in general, I am now curious about anything and everything. At this point, I dabble in multiple mediums and digital programs. 
Pencil, oil painting, sculpture, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere, and now Blender, thanks to ART 102. Adobe Illustrator is what I use most often to 
bring my ideas to fruition. The concepts behind my works vary between things I've experienced and things that I find profound in some way. I am currently 
working on becoming more adept in any software I can and developing my ability to create meaningful and interesting works of art that come from my own experiences or ideas. 
I’m also working on getting a consistent workflow down. If I could have it my way, I’d love to be a freelance artist, exploring reality and expression. 
I would also like to work as a 3D modeler, concept artist, or artistic director for video games or entertainment in general. (I love Sci-Fi.) 
I would like to apply my creativity to graphic design or videography, video editing, and photography, too. I am newly interested in creative coding, 
though I am inept at it as of now, to put it lightly. Ultimately, I want to contribute my creativity to something I can be proud of. But, even if I don’t 
find success making art commercially, I will take the valuable insights I've gained from school and others’ art to express myself as I see fit, as 
much as I can in my lifetime. With what I’ve learned, I feel like I have to. It’s now similar to any other form of essential human expression, like 
laughing or crying. If you don’t get it out somehow, where does it go?
