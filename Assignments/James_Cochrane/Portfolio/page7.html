        "Lucky", 10 x 13 inches, Mixed Media Sculpture

<p>
    Lucky is a piece that is very personal to me. It is a representation of my messed up foot as well as what I learned from it. It's made from
    wood, steel, plaster, concrete, and flip-flop. In 7th grade, I developed a tumor in the bridge bone of my left foot. I had several surgeries and 5 bones in my foot ended up being
    replaced with one formation of donor's bone. It's a problem, it's uncomfortable to this day and will only get worse. But I certainly learned
    a lot from the ordeal, mainly how incredibly fortunate I am. Sure, what happened sucks, but every time I went into the children's hospital for imaging,
    I saw several kids who were undergoing chemotherapy. It wasn't that bad for me. At the time I didn't think all that much of it.
    But at this point in my life, it's apparent to me that there is much I take for granted. I exist in California,
    (hence, flip-flop) where some of the best doctors in the world were able to
    operate on me. My parents were able to pay for the treatment, mostly, at least. Also, I am alive in the first place.
