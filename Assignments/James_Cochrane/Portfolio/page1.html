    In this piece, I wanted to convey the expansive unknown and wonder of the ocean. I have always loved the ocean, particularly
    because of its mysteriousness and biodiversity. It's like an alien world in our backyard, where you can find anything from horrifying giant squid to
    friendly dolphins. It's incredible. And we are destroying it at an alarming rate. I often wonder what the ocean will be like in 20 years.
